If that is the case, use `new constructor(arg1, arg2)`, for example.\n// It is not necessary to use this function if the function that needs an array of arguments is not supposed to be used as a constructor.\n// - If that is the case, use `f.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2...])`, for example.\nfunction applyToNew(constructor, argsArray) {\n    // The `new` keyword can only be applied to functions that take a limited number of arguments.\n    // - We can fake that with .bind().\n    // - It calls a function (`constructor`, here) with the arguments that were provided to it - effectively transforming an unlimited number of arguments into limited.\n    // - So `new (constructor.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2...))`\n    // - `thisArg` can be anything (e.g. null) because `new` keyword resets context to the constructor object.\n    // We need to pass in a variable number of arguments to the bind() call.\n    // - We can use .apply().\n    // - So `new (constructor.bind.apply(constructor, [thisArg, arg1, arg2...]))`\n    // - `thisArg` can still be anything because `new` overwrites it.\n    // Finally, to make sure that constructor.bind overwriting is not a problem, we switch to `Function.prototype.bind`.\n    // - So, the final version is `new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(constructor, [thisArg, arg1, arg2...]))`\n\n    // The function expects `argsArray[0]` to be `thisArg`.\n    // - This means that whatever is sent as the first element will be ignored.\n    // -

The `obj` argument acts as parent.\n// - This function creates a new object that inherits all `obj` properties and adds/replaces those that are present in arguments.\n// - A high-level example: calling `extend(Vehicle, Car)` would be akin to declaring `class Car extends Vehicle`.\nfunction extend(obj) {\n    // In JavaScript, the combination of a constructor function (e.g. `g.Line = function(...) {...}`) and prototype (e.g. `g.Line.prototype = {...}) is akin to a C++ class.\n    // - When inheritance is not necessary, we can leave it at that. (This would be akin to calling extend with only `obj`.)\n    // - But, what if we wanted the `g.Line` quasiclass to inherit from another quasiclass (let's call it `g.GeometryObject`) in JavaScript?\n    // - First, realize that both of those quasiclasses would still have their own separate constructor function.\n    // - So what we are actually saying is that we want the `g.Line` prototype to inherit from `g.GeometryObject` prototype.\n    // - This method provides a way to do exactly that.\n    // - It copies parent prototype's properties, then adds extra ones from child prototype/overrides parent prototype properties with child prototype properties.\n    // - Therefore, to continue with the example above:\n    //   - `g.Line.prototype = extend(g.GeometryObject.prototype, linePrototype)`\n    //   - Where `linePrototype` is a properties object that looks just like `g.Line.prototype` does right now.\n    //   - Then, `g.Line` would allow the programmer to access to all methods currently in `g.Line.Prototype`, plus any non-overridden methods from `g.GeometryObject.prototype`.\n    //   - In that aspect, `g.GeometryObject` would then act like the parent of `g.Line`.\n    // - Multiple inheritance is also possible, if multiple arguments are provided.\n    // - What if we wanted to add another level of abstraction between `g.GeometryObject` and `g.Line` (let's call it `g.LinearObject`)?\n    //   - `g.Line.prototype = extend(g.GeometryObject.prototype, g.LinearObject.prototype, linePrototype)`\n    //   - The ancestors are applied in order of appearance.\n    //   - That means that `g.Line` would have inherited from `g.LinearObject` that would have inherited from `g.GeometryObject`.\n    //   - Any number of ancestors may be provided.\n    // - Note that neither `obj` nor any of the arguments need to actually be prototypes of any JavaScript quasiclass, that was just a simplified explanation.\n    // - We can create a new object composed from the properties of any number of other objects (since they do not have a constructor, we can think of those as interfaces).\n    //   - `extend({ a: 1, b: 2 }, { b: 10, c: 20 }, { c: 100, d: 200 })` gives `{ a: 1, b: 10, c: 100, d: 200 }`.\n    //   - Basically, with this function, we can emulate the `extends` keyword as well as the `implements` keyword.\n    // - Therefore, both of the following are valid:\n    //   - `Lineto.prototype = extend(Line.prototype, segmentPrototype, linetoPrototype)`\n    //   - `Moveto.prototype = extend(segmentPrototype,
